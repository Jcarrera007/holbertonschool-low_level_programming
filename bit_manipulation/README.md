# 🧠 Bit Manipulation & Learning to Learn

## 🔍 Learning How to Learn (Without Too Much Help)

One of the most valuable skills in programming isn't just knowing the answer — it's knowing **how to find it**. Here’s how you can become more independent as a learner:

### ✅ Tips for Finding Information Effectively

- **Search precisely**: Use targeted queries like `C bitwise operators`, `bit masking examples`, or `shift operators in C`.
- **Read official docs**: Sites like [cplusplus.com](https://cplusplus.com), [man7.org](https://man7.org), and the [ISO C standard](https://en.cppreference.com/) are goldmines.
- **Try first, Google later**: Struggle with a problem for 15–30 minutes before seeking help.
- **Experiment in a sandbox**: Use tools like [replit.com](https://replit.com/) or [godbolt.org](https://godbolt.org/) to test small snippets of code quickly.
- **Ask smart questions**: When you do ask for help, be clear about what you tried, what you expected, and what happened.

## ⚙️ Bit Manipulation in C

Bit manipulation lets you **control data at the bit level**, which is powerful for performance, memory efficiency, and low-level programming.

### 🛠️ Bitwise Operators

| Operator | Name            | Example (`a = 5`, `b = 3`) | Result |
|----------|------------------|-----------------------------|--------|
| `&`      | AND              | `a & b` → `0101 & 0011`     | `0001` (1) |
| `|`      | OR               | `a | b` → `0101 | 0011`     | `0111` (7) |
| `^`      | XOR              | `a ^ b` → `0101 ^ 0011`     | `0110` (6) |
| `~`      | NOT              | `~a` → `~0101`              | `1010` (in 4-bit) |
| `<<`     | Left shift       | `a << 1` → `1010`           | `10` (10) |
| `>>`     | Right shift      | `a >> 1` → `0010`           | `2` |

### 📦 Common Bit Tricks

- **Set a bit**: `x |= (1 << n);`
- **Clear a bit**: `x &= ~(1 << n);`
- **Toggle a bit**: `x ^= (1 << n);`
- **Check a bit**: `(x & (1 << n)) != 0`

## 🧪 Practice Ideas

- Convert binary strings to integers
- Implement bit masks to pack/unpack data
- Create flag systems using bits
- Write functions like `get_bit`, `set_bit`, `clear_bit`
